### What is it?
BackStack is a JavaScript component/extension for <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone' target='_blank'>Backbone.js</a> it allows you to create nice view
transitions in your HTML5 apps. By default it comes with an implementation of mobile-style slide transitions, fade transitions and no-effect transitions.
It is conceptually based on <a href='http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/spark/components/ViewNavigator.html' target='_blank'>ViewNavigator API</a> from mobile SDK of
<a href='http://incubator.apache.org/flex/' target='_blank'>Apache Flex framework</a>. It provides developers means to manage stack of views that can be pushed, popped or replaced.

### Why should I use it?
Although you can use it for web development (as I did to create <a href='http://pwalczyszyn.github.com/backstack' target='_blank'>this</a> site) it is especially useful when building mobile apps with PhoneGap/Cordova framework.
Of course if you are using frameworks like <a href='http://jquerymobile.com/' target='_blank'>jQuery Mobile</a>, <a href='http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/' target='_blank'>Sencha Touch</a>, <a href='http://www.jqtouch.com/' target='_blank'>jQTouch</a> or probably dozen of other mobile UI frameworks you don't need it.

### Are there other alternatives?

You can use ViewNavigator implementation from <a href="http://triceam.github.com/app-UI/" target="_blank">app-UI</a> framework built by fellow Adobe Evangelist <a href="http://tricedesigns.com/" target="_blank">Andy Trice</a>. Of course you can build the transitions yourself, it is not really hard ;) or use already mentioned frameworks above.

### How was it built?

This may not be particularly interesting to everyone but to develop/package BackStack an <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/almond" target="_blank">almond</a> library was used. Almond is a replacement AMD loader for RequireJS. It is a smaller "shim" loader, providing the minimal AMD API footprint that includes loader plugin support.

### Where can I find more info about it?
<a href='http://pwalczyszyn.github.com/backstack' target='_blank'>Here is a demo site</a> that is actually built with BackStack. Be aware of a disclaimer that I only tested it with WebKit based browsers as I mainly used it for mobile apps development. So if you are on IE this site many not work for you, sorry for that ;)

You can also checkout a <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/pwalczyszyn/dwRQU' target='_blank'>simple example</a> that is available on jsFiddle.


### BackStack.StackNavigator class API
<div>
    <h3>Constructor</h3>


    <ul>
        <li><strong>options</strong> - Backbone view options hash.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>options.popTransition</strong> - default transition effect object to be used during pop operations.</li>
                <li><strong>options.pushTransition</strong> - default transition effect object to be used during push operations.</li>

        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>
        BackStack.StackNavigator eventing model is based on Backbone's events implementation.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>StackNavigator#viewChanging</strong> - It's triggered just before view on the stack is changed. This event is cancelable and the view change can be stopped using <code>event.preventDefault()</code> function.
                <h4>Event object properties:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>action</strong> - this property can have following values: push, pop, popAll, replace and replaceAll.</li>
                    <li><strong>fromViewClass</strong> - class of a from view.</li>
                    <li><strong>fromView</strong> - instance of a from view.</li>
                    <li><strong>toViewClass</strong> - class of a to view.</li>
                    <li><strong>toView</strong> - instance of a to view.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>StackNavigator#viewChanged</strong> - It's triggered after view on the stack is changed. This event cannot be canceled.
                <h4>Event object properties:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>target</strong> - Instance of BackStack.StackNavigator that triggered this event.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backbone.View#viewActivate</strong> - This event is triggered when view is activated on the stack.
                <h4>Event object properties:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>target</strong> - Instance of a view that was activated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backbone.View#viewDeactivate</strong> - This event is triggered when view is deactivated on the stack. Either it was popped or it was covered by another view.
                <h4>Event object properties:</h4>
                <ul>
